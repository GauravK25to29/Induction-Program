# Induction-Program

## Day 1
30th of July
### My first day of the induction program started with a visit to Gurudwara Sahib at 8:30 AM, as mentioned in the schedule. The Gurudwara looked very peaceful and beautiful — like a flying ship in the sky. Inside, we saw the holy Guru Granth Sahib, and after the prayers, we were offered tea and sandwiches. That moment felt very calm and spiritual.

### Around 9:20 AM, I headed towards the auditorium for the main induction program. Before entering, there was a registration desk where my ID was checked. My name was found in the computer list, and I was given a file containing the campus prospectus, a diary, and a pen.

### After entering the auditorium, the session began with a welcome note from a doctor (probably a faculty head). Later, some technical issue happened with the mic or sound system, but it was managed.

### Then, Sehijpal Singh Principal Sir gave us a motivational speech which really inspired me. A chief guest also gave a powerful talk and introduced us to the vision of the college. I don’t remember the name exactly, but the speech was very encouraging.

### We also got to know that the campus is very big and spread across a lot of land.

### After the program ended, I returned home feeling excited about the journey ahead. My first day at campus was a mix of peace, learning, and motivation.

## Day 2
1st of August
### The second day of my induction program started with a session at 9:00 AM. Many teachers and faculty members were present. They shared valuable information about the campus, its facilities, and different departments. They also gave motivational speeches, encouraging us to make the most of our time here. It felt good to hear their experiences and advice.

### After the induction sessions, a proficiency test was scheduled for all students. The test was related to Maths and English, and it started at 12:30 PM. A professor came in to explain the instructions and rules of the test.

### The test was 50 minutes long and had 30 marks in total. It included 13 questions from both English and Maths. I attempted the test seriously and did my best. I know my English is weak, but I still tried with full confidence.

### This was my first academic experience on campus, and even though it was a bit challenging, I enjoyed the learning process. I feel the induction program is well-designed because it doesn’t just welcome us but also prepares us for the upcoming journey.

### In my opinion, Day 2 was a good mix of learning and testing. It helped me understand the level of preparation expected from us and also made me feel a bit more comfortable in the new environment.

## Day 3
4th of August
### The third day of the induction program was scheduled to start at 8:30 AM, but due to some delay with the mic setup, it actually began around 9:00 AM.

### The session started with an introduction to something called Columbus Apex 80 — though I didn’t fully understand it, it seemed related to technology or tools used in our studies.

### After that, Dr. Priya Darshni Ma'am gave us a thoughtful lecture on human values and universal human happiness. The topic was deep but very important. The speaker talked about values like respect, kindness, and understanding others — not just for engineers, but for life in general. I found this lecture very meaningful and eye-opening.

### Next, we were given information about the conduct of examinationsband introduction about our campus and faculty provides by campus. 

### After that, there was a surprising but interesting part — someone gave a talk about cars, especially sports cars, and how automobile technology is used in real life. It was fun and informative.

### The final session was by Mr. Jaswant Singh from CS, who gave a strong motivational speech about engineering as a field. He explained how engineering shapes the world and encouraged us to stay focused, curious, and passionate.

### By the end of this day, I felt more inspired and positive. It was a mix of values, technology, and motivation — a great combination to move forward.
