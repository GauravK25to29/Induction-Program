## 📅 Day 1 – 30th July  
✨ **Peace, Learning & Motivation**  

The first day began with a visit to **Gurudwara Sahib** at 8:30 AM, as scheduled. The Gurudwara looked peaceful and beautiful — like a flying paper in the sky. Inside, we saw the holy **Guru Granth Sahib**. After prayers, tea and snakes were served, creating a calm and spiritual inside me.  

By 10:30 AM, I reached the auditorium for the main induction program. At registration, my ID was checked, my name confirmed, and I received a **prospectus, diary, and pen**.  

The session started with a welcome note from faculty. Later, **Principal Sehijpal Singh Sir** give us a motivational speech, followed by a talk from the chief guest about the college vision. I also learned the campus is very large and well-developed.  

I ended the day feeling excited about the journey ahead.
